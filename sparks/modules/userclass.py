'''
Behavior notes:
	- Learning a user from join will not fill in their GECOS
	- Nicks are compared via basic checks; changing them to lowercase and matching
		- this means Sno|Fox and Sno\Fox; and Sno[Fox] and Sno{Fox} are "different" nicks,
			which is incorrect behavior for IRC.

TODO:
	- Nick changes are currently not supported
	- Mode changes do not work
	- Prefixes don't work
